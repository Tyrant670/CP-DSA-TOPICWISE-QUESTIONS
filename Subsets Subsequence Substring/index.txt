Here i want to tell the difference between 3 things :
(1) Subsets
(2) Subsequences
(3) Substrings

(1) Subsets :
	In Subsets , It contains all the possible sets of a given set including 
	null set.
	
	e.g. string s="abc"
	
	Posssible subsets are:
	{ " " , "a" , "b" , "c" , "ab" , "bc" , "ca" , "abc" }

(2) Subsequences :
	In Subsequences, It can have all the possible set of anything but
	the order will be maintained.
	I want to explain it by taking example.

	e.g. string="abc"

	Possible subsequences are:
	{ "a" , "b" , "c" , "ab" ,"bc" , "ac" , "abc" } are subsequences but
	{ "ca" , "ba" } are not subsequences because 
	the order are changed. a should come before c and b as in 
	original string.

(3) Substring :
	In Substrings, they form contigues part of a given string.
	You can not take like first char and then last char
	You've to take in continues order and can't skip the char
	in between.
	
	e.g. string="abcd"
	{ "a" , "b" , "ab" , "bc" , "cd" , "abc" , "bcd" , "abcd" , "c" , "d" } are  substrings

	{ "ac" , "bd" , "acd"  } these are not substrings because you skip the 
	charcters between first and last char from original string.
